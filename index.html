        <td>Hello, my name is Jacque. I'm from a musical family and really love it!  My husband is a drummer, my son plays guitar, my daughter is a violinist currently attending UNT and majoring in music.  I used to sing, not much anymore (my voice is a bit worn out) I still write though. I'll share a link to my BandMix page <a href="https://www.bandmix.com/jacqueline-raquel/">Jacque's Music page</a> I have a few songs posted that I sang on and wrote.  I'm originally from California but lived in Reno, NV for 10 years before moving up here. I moved up here 14 years ago and have been a "banker" for the past 13 years.  </td>
        <td>After graduating from high school I went to Delta College the junior college in the town I grew up in.  I took a few courses there but didn't know what I wanted to do so I decided that I would hit the road and travel instead.  It wasn't until later on that I decided to go back to school.  I attended Truckee Community College in Reno, NV and took a web development course and an HTML4 class (yep that was a long time ago) I really loved it but, unfortunately life took over and we had to move.  I am now in control of my destiny and am fortunate to be enrolled in Code Fellows.  This is the begining to my new life's journey!</td>
        <td>I can count how many jobs that I've had on one hand.  I've been an Entertainer, I've worked at a casino in the Sales & Marketing Department and Special Events, I currently work at a bank. Longevity, I find a place and stay put. </td>
        <td>My dream job is to be a Software Developer. Yes, finally!</td>
